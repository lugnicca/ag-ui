 * Parsing is deliberately more forgiving than that invariant: an explicit
 * `null` is accepted and coerced to absent. Pydantic models serialized with a
 * plain `model_dump()` — no `exclude_none=True` — emit `"metadata": null` for
 * an unset object, and rejecting that would make the Python SDK fail to parse
 * its own output. This is the same treatment `parentMessageId` and `outcome`
 * already receive in `events.ts`, for exactly the same reason.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry, which is intentional: a `null` *value under a key* is
 * meaningful data and is preserved. Only a `null` in place of the whole object
 * is treated as absent.

 * A message is assembled from a sequence of events, and the interesting values
 * — token usage and finish reason among them — are only known at the end. So
 * metadata accumulates as the sequence arrives rather than being fixed at the
 * start.
 *
 * A key's value is replaced outright. This never recurses, so an array or
 * object under any key — including {@link AGUI_METADATA_KEY} — is replaced
 * wholesale rather than blended with what was there before.
 *
 * Returns a new object rather than mutating either argument. An absent
 * `incoming` returns `existing` untouched; an empty `incoming` changes nothing.
